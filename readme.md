## 📝 Description

This is my completed solution for **Project 02: Password Strength Meter**. The program evaluates the strength of a user-entered password based on length, character variety, digits, and special characters. It provides helpful feedback for weak passwords and encourages secure password practices. 

The project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Python fundamentals (functions, conditionals, input/output)
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Practical use of string manipulation and logic
