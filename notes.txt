 Project 02: Password Strength Meter
ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build a Password Strength Meter in Python that evaluates a user's password based on security rules. The program will:

Analyze passwords based on length, character types, and patterns.
Assign a strength score (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
Provide feedback to improve weak passwords.
Use control flow, type casting, strings, and functions.
ðŸ”¹ Requirements
1. Password Strength Criteria
A strong password should:
âœ… Be at least 8 characters long
âœ… Contain uppercase & lowercase letters
âœ… Include at least one digit (0-9)
âœ… Have one special character (!@#$%^&*)

2. Scoring System
Weak (Score: 1-2) â†’ Short, missing key elements
Moderate (Score: 3-4) â†’ Good but missing some security features
Strong (Score: 5) â†’ Meets all criteria
3. Feedback System
If the password is weak, suggest improvements.
If the password is strong, display a success message.

ðŸ”¹ Additional Challenges
Password Generator: Add a feature to suggest a strong password.
User-Friendly Interface: Use Streamlit for a GUI version.
Blacklist Common Passwords: Reject weak passwords like "password123".
Custom Scoring Weights: Give different weights to complexity factors.
ðŸ”¹ Why This Assignment?
âœ… Uses Control Flow & Conditions
âœ… Applies String Manipulation & Regex
âœ… Teaches Security Best Practices
âœ… Prepares for Real-World Applications

ðŸ’¡ Challenge yourself to build a better, more secure password checker! ðŸš€
